Academic Forms Platform (MERN Stack)
This project is an academic platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to allow teachers and students to create, view, and manage academic posts. It includes the functionality for students to join classrooms through email OTPs sent by teachers. The platform enables interaction and sharing of notes in the form of posts.

Student Dashboard: Students can join classrooms using OTPs and view posts related to their courses.
Posts/Notes: Teachers and students can post academic notes, assignments, and other important information.
Authentication: Simple email-based OTP authentication for students to join classrooms.
MERN Stack: The application uses MongoDB for the database, Express.js for the backend framework, React for the frontend, and Node.js for the server.
Tech Stack
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user and classroom data
Express.js: Backend framework for creating API routes
